A comprehensive machine learning framework for predicting survival outcomes and assessing risk levels in cervical cancer patients using multiple algorithms.

Overview

This project implements 5 machine learning models (Random Survival Forest, SVM, KNN, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes) to predict patient survival and stratify risk into Low, Moderate, and High categories. The analysis identifies key prognostic factors and provides individualized risk assessments.

Key Features

Survival Prediction Models: Multiple ML algorithms with performance comparison
Risk Stratification: Three-tier risk classification system
Variable Importance Analysis: Identifies key prognostic factors
Individual Risk Assessment: Personalized risk scoring for new patients
Visualizations: Performance plots and importance charts

Dataset

391 patients (274 training, 117 testing)
21 clinical predictors including FIGO stage, age, treatment, and lifestyle factors
Outcome variables: Survival time (months) and event status (death/alive)
